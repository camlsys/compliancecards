# compliancecards

This is a Python implementation of the Compliance Cards system described in: [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14758)

Advisory Notice:
While this Python implementation of the Compliance Cards system is designed to encode knowledge about EU AI Act compliance, it may not yet be able to deliver this knowledge effectively in real-world conditions without human oversight by EU AI Act compliance experts. At this time, outside of the research environment, we recommend against using this Python implementation of the Compliance Cards system without oversight by said experts. Any updates or changes to this recommendation will be posted here.
